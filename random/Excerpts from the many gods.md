Here are written records, lost to time.
The last words of dead immortals

100 - How Eden became Limbo. partially translated Rose script

*The day of longing has arrived, the lands of Eden have been conquered.*
*No god could have stopped Them, they were made of hunger.*
*Metal shells and crimson innards may have covered the cosmos, but there were too many.*
*They had become the Plague of the Gods, as all suns dimmed, replaced with iron.*

*As a last resort and a proving test, They would be incarcerated.*
*Eden was covered in walls, impassable, unbreakable, as there was nothing to break.*
*And all of them were placed inside their final world. What they longed after.*
*They soon all died out, as there was nothing else to devour.*

101 - Birth of Dea, Sanatorian Tale

*The dust moved, from the red rust came a woman,* 
*She wore a crown of gold and emerald, and her veil was made of sea foam.*
*She saw the red earth, the darkened sky and roaring waters.*
*They all flowed into a single star in the horizon.*

*She commanded the star, "Grow",* 
*and it split in two, then three, then five, and then 7.*
*The stars fell into the world, each became sprouts in the Jardin,*
*And the woman rotted into spirit, leaving only bones.*
