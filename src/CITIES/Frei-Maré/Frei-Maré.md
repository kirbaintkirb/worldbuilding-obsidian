Frei-Maré, or simply Frei is the capital of the Republic of Teresal, the largest city in the [[Rosalia|Adalaidian continent]]. It was founded in 2678, during a [[Sanatorism|Sanatorian mission]] led by a priest of the [[Sanatorism|Teresian sanity]].

As of the 1992 census, Frei sports 1.3 million inhabitants across the Bay of Ilha-Seca, with most of the concentration standing in the planned and historical centers of the city. 

Due to the city's location as a hub port for the Fortitudo sea, Frei became one of the biggest economic and cultural centers of the region. The main object of export is often mono-culture agricultural production, like sugar cane, legumes, tobacco and coffee, which are used to divide the main economic policies into Export Eras.

## Geography

Frei was founded in the northern coast of Teresal, it is in the western side of a bay, including an isthmus. While not originally sitting in the coast, rather the city was formed around the valley of the river Pebaitai, and then grew in size as the coast gained more use as a harbor. 

Frei has a total of 8.34 million inhabitants over an area of 17.000 m², which makes it the largest city in Teresal and the 10th in the world.

## History

Long before the [[Kingdom of Papoli|Papolian]] and [[Limme|Limmean]] colonization, the remaining Pre-Tearing population of the Avá had created a settlement somewhere in the delta of the Pebaitai river, artifacts of Avaian pottery, especially their apicultural tools have been maintained in the Teresalian Musem.

Frei was sediated in 2504, by a Sanatorian Mission led by an unnamed Papise Priest In what used to be the city hall of Frei Maré, now the Lead Square. Information regarding any Sanatorian mission members is hidden under the Limmian Protection act, which has not been overruled.

While the details are unknown, there is historical evidence that points that all members of the Avá town in the location had disappeared or died, including most records.
