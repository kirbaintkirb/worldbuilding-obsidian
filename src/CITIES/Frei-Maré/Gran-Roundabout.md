> ###### Gran-Roundabout 

The district of Gran-Roundabout or simply Roundabout is a geographical area in [[Frei-Maré]], part of the Central Region. Historically it is also known as the "Old Center" or "First Center" due to being part of the first agglomeration from which Frei-Maré started growing from once the Papolian colonizers settled.

The name has its origin from the circular streets that tangents the river Ava, originally built as a way to aid in transport throughout the periphery of town.

Gran-Roundabout mostly entered its era of business and property failure in the 1980's, when Teresalian state became extremely indebted to foreign loans, sparking an initial wave of new businesses in times of financial difficulty. This however overloaded the usage of automobiles, which in turn made the costs of maintenance for the cars and streets to skyrocket.

The Maresian prefecture then established the creation of an Urban Redevelopment plan, which would apply goals of asphalt and a new planned center, as to lessen the influx of people cause by urban pendular travel.

Once the Frei Urban Redevelopment Plan started to go into action, the big businesses that had existed in Roundabout moved or were extinguished in favor of the secondary city center of [[Villes]], sitting farther from the coast, which required less maintenance from sea brine. Villes then attracted most of the movement towards it, sending Roundabout into being almost empty.
