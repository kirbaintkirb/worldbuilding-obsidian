The Federative Republic of Teresal, or simply Teresal, is a democratic parliamentarian republic and the biggest country on the [[Adalaidia|Adalaidian plate]]. Teresal has a long history of colonization by [[Kingdom of Papoli]] and [[Limme]], serving as an ultramarine territory for half of it's history. Today it sits as an independent sovereign state, after the Common Annulment of 2899, which gave it independence.  

The biggest metropolis of the country [[Frei-Maré]] and it's capital [[Tersa]] are the biggest contributors to population and economy. However Frei is economically dependent on [[Telemach]], due to it's alliance in the [[Clean Wars]]

# Geography

## History

Teresal was founded initially during the colonization period by Papoli and Limme, where it was explored for the especially durable crystalline dark-wood, utilized in the structure maritime vessels and, aeronautical rotor-aerostats. 

Papoli arrived in Teresal in 2670, folllowed by Limme in 2677

## Politics

Teresal is a Democratic Theocracy, meaning, every 5 years there is a national referendum that chooses a religious scripture to be followed as law. While officially the process lends to complexity given each text is it's own constitution, there exists a baseline of rules and precedents that either all parties agree as universal, or all parties agree it's beneficial.
