The City-State of Villuvi is a small [[Ametrie|Ametrian]] nation, with little sovereignty, existing mostly as a monument to the [[Omega Bombs]], which destroyed the [[Crown of Deluge]], the old Nation of which the city of Villuvi was its capital. The crater of Villuvi is filled with water as a nearby river filled the basin, the city was rebuilt surrounding the impact zone

Villuvi was formed after the dissolution of Deluge, and in fact was built atop the crater of the Omega-L bomb, which was one of the 26 used during the end of the [[Yearly War]]. Due to the dangers posed, the International Committee of Amity (ICA), established the City-State as a Zone of No-Conflict or *Hors-de-combat*, to allow communication between warring states.

The Zone of No Conflict was set as a zone of scientific cooperation between ICA members, to aid in progress. It is here where Bartholomeo Verity, wrote the fundamental framework for the [[Accretionism|Accretionist]] philosophies.
