*"The Second World"*

Makro is a [[Plates|Plate]] in [[Chroma]], it was the first one to have been explored after the [[Stentorian Ruin]] during the [[Ametrie|Ametrian colonization]] period.

The first to arrive on the continent were [[Kingdom of Papoli]] then [[Limme]]

North of Makro is the micro-plate [[Icro]], which is easily navigable without [[Interplate Vessels]], this fact has led to much discussion in the Casrtographical comunity on wether to consider Ikro a separate landmass to Makro, however the settlement was once it was discovered Ikro was going to separate from Makro naturally, giving it its micro-plate classification. Today the rift between the plates is 6mm wide.
