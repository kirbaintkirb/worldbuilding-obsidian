*"The sunless lands"*

The Pole or the Polar Plate is one most extreme and coldest regions places in [[The World]]. Due to it's position below [[Ametrie|the Ametrian plate]], little to no sunlight reaches there.

## Etymology

For years after discovery, Pole was named Farrange, or the 101 thousand needles. Pole is visible from Ametrie through the [[Catastrophe Zones#5. Limbo|Limbo]]. The small bit of sunlight entering the plate hits only the peaks and snow particles, creating an effect in sundown of golden particles against the backdrop of the Five Sister Peaks.

Once further exploration was achieved however, including the settlement of [[Landam]], the name was changed to represent the [[Gigantic Pillar]], a literal Pole in the World.
