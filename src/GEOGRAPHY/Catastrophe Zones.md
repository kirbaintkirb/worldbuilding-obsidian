*"Between all of us there is a Black Sea which forbids true connection"*

Catastrophe Zones, CZs, also known colloquially as Black Seas are a catastrophic feature that exists on the edge of every continent of [[Chroma]], they are an extra dense column of vacuum that rises into the thermosphere, dividing the world into [[Plates]].

### Physical properties

The CZ contains multiple different properties depending on the depth traveled on the vacuum. The natural effects of vacuum creates effects similar to altitude, considering the rarefaction of oxygen and lower temperatures, and the destruction of classical weather systems.  Though the most predominant feature of the Catastrophe Zone is the discrepancy of the distance when entering and leaving. 

Recorded early pedometers of the Pallor Zone and laser measured kilometrage when approaching the Edge, ranged from 10 to 13 kilometers. However leaving the Zone accounted by a dramatically lower value, reaching 2 to 3 kilometers. This phenomenon is entirely unexplained and congruent within all zones.

Studies focused on exploring the zones have divided the Catastrophe Zones into sub-zones, there are 5 total, each with their own characteristic
#### 1. The Edge - Pallor Zone

The Edge is a transition zone between the ocean and the Black Sea , the sky here is a permanent grey. The effects of the vacuum here are minimal.

#### 2. Livor Zone

The Livor zone is characterized by a constant rain, usually never getting past a drizzle, though rarely becoming an isolated storm. Here more major effects can be seen, including larger waves.

#### 3. Algor Zone

The Algor zone is characterized by the sky being completely darkened, and no sunlight reaches the surface, temperatures reach the negatives and some ice is formed in the ocean. At this point the air is rarefied, and symptoms similar to altitude sickness may occur.

Though rare, some reported cases of pockets of no oxygen, or even no ocean have been observed.

#### 4. Rigor Zone

At this point the ocean traversal though normal boats is impossible, as thick ice covers the rest of the ocean. From her onward travel is done through specialized [[Long Distance Vessels]], that can cross the ice and the Core zone.

#### 5. Limbo

Here the sky is visible, no other climate effects cross over into this zone. there is however, no ground to cross or air to breathe, therefore this zone is not traversable without the help of limbic vessels. 


### Travel

While the pockets of air diminish the effect of the initial rising column of water, the negative gravity and the vacuum poses a problem. An aeronautical vessel must be able to cross the core vacuum to reach the other side and maintain it's speed enough as to not be repelled back by the negative gravity.

To fix this, the implementation of an engine that utilizes [[Sprit|sprit]] devices is utilize to generate a constant burst of power, to counteract the lack of gravity, thus creating the first specimens
