The World, Chroma, Yard, Aeden,  or Varna is a  dubiously planetary collection of masses called [[Plates]], separated by [[Catastrophe Zones|vacuum]]. It is the place where all of life presumably exists and acts.

The Yard or Jardin is one of the names given to the world, named after the garden of which Dea, the main [[Sanatorism|Sanatorian]] deity sacrificed itself. It is a name derived from the literal word for garden in Arch-Chatte. It is mostly seen in reference to [[Sanatorism|sanatorian texts]].

A long time ago, before the [[Fractured Era]], the world used to be called Aeden.

While Rose script has not been fully translated , Aeden is presumed refer to 'the Garden' or 'the territory'. But after the [[Stentorian Ruin]] and, all mention of  the Old World's name disappeared from history, instead today called being Chroma or Varna.
