Plates are continental landforms completely surrounded by [[Catastrophe Zones]], containing an atmosphere, hydrosphere and litosphere. Plates as we know them used to be part of a single unified spherical shape given their curvature and satellite analysis. That shape however is long gone, as the [[Stentorian Ruin]] completely altered the form of the planet.

Plates are assumed to vaguely follow a certain curvatur, however outliers like [[Poles]], and [[Icro]] with respectively lower and higher altitudes exist.
