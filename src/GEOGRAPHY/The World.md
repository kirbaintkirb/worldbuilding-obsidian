*The World is the place where history happens.*


The World, Yard, Aeden, Chroma or Varna is a  dubiously planetary collection of masses called [[Plates]], separated by [[Pan-Catastrophe Zones|vacuum]]. It is the place where all of life presumably exists and acts.

The World has about 5 macro Plates: [[Ametrie]], [[Apetra]], [[Adalaidia]], [[Fortuna]] and [[Makro]]. And the three smaller: [[Zodiac]], [[Icro]] and [[Poles]]

The Yard or Jardin is one of the names given to the world, named after the garden of which Dea, the main [[Sanatorism|Sanatorian]] deity sacrificed itself. It is a name derived from the literal word for garden in Arch-Chatte

A long time ago it used to be called Aeden, or we think it might have been called that. Rose script has not been fully translated Aeden simply refers to 'the Garden' or 'the territory'. But after the [[Paroxys]] and [[the 40 Days]], all mention of whatever the Old World's name might've been disappeared from history, instead today called being Chroma or Varna
