*A long long time ago, we did something very wrong, and we haven't recovered since, and we won't recover.*


The World, in Lydic: Chroma, In Chatte: Yard, in Rose: Aeden, or Simantare: Varna is a dubiously planetary collection of masses called [[Plates]], separated by [[Catastrophe Zones|still vacuum]]. It is the place where all of life presumably exists and acts.

The World has about 5 macro Plates: [[Ametrie]], [[Apeter]], [[Rosalia]], [[Fortuna]] and [[Makro]]. And the three smaller: [[Kasha]], [[Icro]] and [[Poles]]

The Yard or Jardin is one of the names given to the world, named after the garden of which Dea, the main [[Sanatorism|Sanatorian]] deity sacrificed itself. It is a name derived from the literal word for garden in Arch-Chatte. It is mostly seen in reference to [[Sanatorism|sanatorian texts]].

A long time ago, before the [[Fractured Era]], the world used to be called Aeden.

While Rose script has not been fully translated , Aeden is presumed refer to 'the Garden' or 'the territory'. But after the [[Stentorian Ruin]] and, all mention of the Old World's name disappeared from history, instead today called being The .

## Shape

Before the Stentorian, the World is assumed to be one continuous mass. The potential shape is lost since the fracturing, though with the current shape of the plates, there are hypothesis that the world was a curved landmass. 

The Plates that currently form the world despite maintaining their curvature, have variations in their altitudes and longitudes, this configuration proposes a navigational problem in [[Interplate Vessels|interplatery travel]], which now has to consider the height of the plate in relation to another, in some extreme cases, plates can be radically below or above another. As measuring tools got better, a reference point, known as Core Measuring was created, which considers the Core height, in tandem with latitude and longitude.

## Meta

Varna = sanskrit for color

Yard = reference to Garden (of Eden)
