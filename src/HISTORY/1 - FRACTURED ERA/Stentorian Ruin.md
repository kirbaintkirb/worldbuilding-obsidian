## Evidence

Most written records of the Stentorian have disappeared with time, oral tradition warping what happened or records having been missing since. Though evidence of an event does exist and is researched by paleontologists, archaeologists and general historians.

### Paleontological

Most compelling evidence of the world once being a singular plate is the fact that fossil records of multiple species have been found across [[Catastrophe Zones]], most notably was the comparison of the fossil of the lithosaur from the genus *Ammosaurus*, first discovered in the year 2899 in [[Apetr]], the lithosaur was assumed to have been present only in that plate, however in 2964, new evidence of another fossil in the neighboring plate [[Ametrie]] was found, the full set having been found by combining fossils from the plates.

### Archaeological

Most of the pre-Stentorian records were found in Rose script stellae
