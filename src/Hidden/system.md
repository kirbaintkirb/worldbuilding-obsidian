A character has a name, age, level, 4 attributes, and a core

Body
Mind
Soul
Reflex

Each of these attributes have a value rolled with a d4.

The core is a short phrase, combined with a stat and a bonus, it represents something your character's quest, be it "Deus ex Machina" or "Stomach ache", actions that forward that goal will automatically have that bonus.

Thoughts are problems and ideas that other people may inspire you with, they can be entertained or discarded.
Thoughts are gained from particularly impressive interactions that affected your character. The thought gained is the opposing characters core.
Each thought has a name, a stat, a strength and an association.

The total value of an attribute represents the amount of thoughts that can be slotted into them.

When rolling for one of the attributes, the thought can give contextual bonuses.

If i roll for Mind, the thought Deus ex Machina can give a +2 bonus.

Thoughts are either discarded or integrated, never put in a tertiary storage.
If you have a though for long enough, the thought is internalized and cannot be discarded.
