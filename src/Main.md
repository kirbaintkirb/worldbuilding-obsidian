[[The World]] is a globalized world. With the advent of overseas communication, there is now a complete deluge of information stored across the world. Silicon is extracted from the farthest reaches of the [[Pan-Catastrophe Zones|nocturnal seas]], and beneath the blues lies liquid gold that shines chemical rainbow.

But you don't get to see it.

Yesterday night, December 10th, 2998, [[Frei-Maré]] was showered in space debris. While nobody was harmed, the debris has not been able to be identified, though the few ceramic pieces that have been collected seem similar to Villuvi-Telemachian spaceships. No launch or currently existing satellite was unaccounted for, investigators and researchers alike are calling this a mysterious accident.

Staged for January 1st, 2999. The [[Borealis DIsaster|Borealis 12 Mission]] is the first manned space launch by Villuvi-Telemachian partnership. After years of attempting to set up a livable Satellite, their first experiment with animals was a success, and they will send three cosmonauts to the orbit of the World.
