[[The World]] is a globalized world. With the advent of overseas communication, there is now a complete deluge of information stored across the world. Silicon is extracted from the farthest reaches of the [[Pan-Catastrophe Zones|nocturnal seas]], and beneath the blues lies liquid gold that shines chemical rainbow.

But you don't get to see it.

You live in the tourist trap of [[Frei-Maré]], and you'll live and die here. If you can call this living. You are born, you study, you stop studying to work and then you die.

But you agree that life can have so much more yes? This world... you know it has to have more than just its surface. There has to be something beyond. Transcendental.
