The Kreatist religion is a polytheistic cult originated in the ancient region of Kera, now modern [[Lydian]] and [[Mixolydian]]. Kreatism contains no gods, rather describing reality as the culmination of a single material, Kreati, translated as "flesh" in Telese. Unlike most ancient religions, Kreasism has a large well recorded history, which unlike most records from the Limmean colonization period, were not burned, but rather poorly maintained or ignored, though a majority of rites were sincretized into [[Sanatorism]] and later [[Accretionism]].

Kreatism did not have a canon, though modern practices utilize a secular text, the actual practices were spread out and thinned across the city states in Ancient Kera. 

The Kreati is described as the material of the world itself, and and can be synonymous with a word for [[The World|the world]]. The flesh has attributes
