Retorcionism, is a New Age Philosophy originated in [[Canthara]], but is much more popular outside its origin. It is the religious framework to seeks to alter the current political format of the [[Current Age|Modern World]] into one where religion and state are separate, making the governmental bureaucracy be in the hands of everyone, not religious books.

Retorcionism is named after an ancient Chatteian concept of Rétorcion, or a "turning of the world (upside down)", it is the ultimate change of paradigm.
