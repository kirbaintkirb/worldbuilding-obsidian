*"A world translating will bring a different season"* - Lalo Villanova

The Rotatorism or the Whirl, is a New Age Philosophy originated in [[Commonwealth of Canthara]], but is much more popular outside its origin. It is the religious framework to seeks to alter the current political format of the [[Current Age|Modern World]] into one where religion and state are separate, making civil institutions independent of decrees. Rotatorism is unrelated to the Democratic Cycle, in which liturgical texts are changed via popular vote.

The Rotatorism is named after an ancient Chatteian concept of revolving, or a "turning of the world (upside down)", it is the ultimate change of paradigm. Whirl is related to that concept, as a Limmean synonym to the revolving.

The cantorian writer Lalo Villanova began the first naming of what is modern rotatorism, with the release of the book "The current paradigm of theopolitics" in 2957. In his book, Villanova described the way in which a theoretical state, where faith and law were separate beings could exist, opposed to the standard theopolitical model, where laws are treated within the same record as religion.

The book had little impact in Canthara, selling 100 units sold. However copies of it reached what at the time was the [[City-State of Villuvi]]. The popularity of the concept allowed Villuvi to consider the Rotatorism as the state format, before it was bombarded at the end of the [[Yearly War]] however.

Opposite to the Whirl, a counter-movement to the disestablishment exists, known as the Stillness, which seeks to maintain and strengthen the bond of state and religion
