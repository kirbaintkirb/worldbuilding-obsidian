*"The history of Sanatorism is entrenched with politics, so much so that it dragged and other religions into  the same being"*

Sanatorism is a [[Kingdom of Papoli|Papolian]] originated doctrine, pertaining eternity through taking care of yourself. Sanatorism originated from before the [[Stentorian Ruin]], being a derivative of proto-Monotheism.

## Theological Origin

In Sanatorism, every living creature at the start of The World was gifted by a Nameless deity a wafer of life, also known as a Particle. Through living, the wafer expires until death, where it stops existing completely.

To maintain the Particle, Sanatorism documents rituals that can slow down the decomposition of life and extend it's duration into a post-life state. Some of the most important precepts laid out by Sty. Peter is that "Care of  the Particle leads to eternity", which is the basis laid out by the Book of Sanatorian Rituals.

## Sanities

Sanities are those who through practice have discovered ways to take care of their Particles until perfection, thus attaining the end of their lives early. The discovered practices are catalogued and accepted through a beatification process. Today there are 108 sanities and more than 350 rituals cataloged.

Though not necessarily the most important, here are a few Sanities:

- Peter the 1st: The first human sanity, attained through the ritual of breathing, story-telling and self-flagellation. Depicted without a face and a bullwhip.

- Teresa the 20th (Patroness of [[Republic of Teresal|Teresal]]): Attained sanity through the ritual tying of knots, poetry and blood-letting. Depicted with her wrist tied in a red string.

- Rosa the 21st: (Named the plate [[Rosalia]]), attained sanity through the ritual of tilling, deciphering and rotting. Depicted with a mummified hand, still attached.

- Sebastian the 76th: attained sanity through archery, lucid dreaming and arsenic. Depicted with a green bow and arrow

- Garza the 108th: (Patron of [[City-State of Villuvi|Villuvi]]) The most recent sanity, attained through swimming, limbic exploration and exploding. Depicted with a glass bowl atop his head,

## Rituals

The main ritual of Sanatorism comes from that maintaining of the wafer of life, a person can utilize any or most of the methods used by the sanity to achieve Post-life.
