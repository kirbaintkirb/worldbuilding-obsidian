*"Bless your corpuscule, in the name of your sanities"* - Common Sanatorian blessing

Sanatorism is a [[Kingdom of Papoli|Papolian]] originated doctrine, pertaining eternity through taking care of yourself. Sanatorism originated from before the [[Stentorian Ruin]], being a derivative of proto-Monotheism.

## Theological Origin

In Sanatorism, every living creature at the start of The World was gifted by a Nameless deity a wafer of life, also known as a Corpuscule. Through living, the wafer expires until death, where it stops existing completely. In more secular interpretations the Corpuscule is instead seen as the *corpus* or body.

To maintain the wafer, Sanatorism documents rituals that can slow down the decomposition of life and extend it's duration into a post-life state. Some of the most important precepts laid out by Sty. Peter is that "Care of  the Corpuscule leads to eternity", which is the basis laid out by the Book of Sanatorian Rituals.

## The Corpuscule Symbol

The Particle in Sanatorism is represented through a symbol places usually on the middle of the chest, above the heart. Some people wear or mark the sanatorian symbol on themselves, as a representation of love. Though with the diffusion of the practice, it has become a more common place symbol for health. The Particle is utilized across healthcare as a semi universal symbol of health, and is utilized as a marker of hospitals across the Sanatorian Pole.

The symbol originated on early depiction of the particle, a small bulb of Fig with a single leaf usually carried by Dea, given to a representative of mankind. For that reason, sanities are usually seen with a Canopy halo, to say the particle has sprouted and grown beyond themselves.
