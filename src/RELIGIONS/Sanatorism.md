*"The history of Sanatorism is entrenched with politics, so much so that it dragged and other religions into  the same being"*

Sanatorism is a [[Papoli|Papolian]] originated doctrine, pertaining eternity through taking care of yourself.

## Theological Origin

In Sanatorism, every living creature at the start of The World was gifted by a Nameless deity a wafer of life, also known as a Particle. Through living, the wafer expires until death, where it stops existing completely.

To maintain the Particle, Sanatorism documents rituals that can slow down the decomposition of life and extend it's duration into a post-life state. Some of the most important precepts laid out by Sty. Peter is that "Care of  the Particle leads to eternity", which is the basis laid out by the Book of Sanatorian Rituals.

## Sanities

Sanities are those who through practice have discovered ways to take care of their Particles until perfection, thus attaining the end of their lives early. The discovered practices are catalogued and accepted through a beatification process. Today there are 108 sanities and more than 350 rituals catalogued.

Though not necessarily the most important, here are a few Sanities:

- Peter: The first human sanity, attained through the ritual of breathing, story-telling and self-flagellation.

- Teresa (Patroness of [[Republic of Teresal|Teresal]]): Attained sanity through the ritual tying of knots, poetry and blood-letting.

- Sebastian: attained sanity through archery, lucid dreaming and arsenic.

## Rituals

The main ritual of Sanatorism comes from that maintaining of the wafer of life, a person can utilize any or most of the methods used by the sanity to achieve Post-life.
