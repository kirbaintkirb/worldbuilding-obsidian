*"Bless your corpuscule, in the name of your sanities"* - Common Sanatorian blessing

Sanatorism is a [[Kingdom of Papoli|Papolian]] originated doctrine, pertaining eternity through taking care of yourself. Sanatorism originated from before the [[Stentorian Ruin]], being a derivative of proto-Monotheism.

## Theological Origin

In Sanatorism, every living creature at the start of The World was gifted by a Nameless deity a wafer of life, also known as a Corpuscule. Through living, the wafer expires until death, where it stops existing completely. In more secular interpretations the Corpuscule is instead seen as the *corpus* or body.

To maintain the wafer, Sanatorism documents rituals that can slow down the decomposition of life and extend it's duration into a post-life state. Some of the most important precepts laid out by Sty. Peter is that "Care of  the Corpuscule leads to eternity", which is the basis laid out by the Book of Sanatorian Rituals.

## The Corpuscule Symbol

The Particle in Sanatorism is represented through a symbol places usually on the middle of the chest, above the heart. Some people wear or mark the sanatorian symbol on themselves, as a representation of love. Though with the diffusion of the practice, it has become a more common place symbol for health. The Particle is utilized across healthcare as a semi universal symbol of health, and is utilized as a marker of hospitals across the Sanatorian Pole.

The symbol originated on early depiction of the particle, a small bulb of Fig with a single leaf usually carried by Dea, given to a representative of mankind. For that reason, sanities are usually seen with a Canopy halo, to say the particle has sprouted and grown beyond themselves.

## Sanities

Sanities are those who through practice have discovered ways to take care of their Particles until perfection, thus attaining the end of their lives early. The discovered practices are catalogued and accepted through a beatification process. Today there are 108 sanities and more than 350 rituals cataloged.

Though not necessarily the most important, here are a few Sanities:

- Dea the 0th: The first sanity ever, described as completely inhuman, bordering animalistic and purely conceptual.

- Peter the 1st: The first human sanity, attained through the ritual of breathing, story-telling and self-flagellation. Depicted without a face and a bullwhip.

- Teresa the 20th (Patroness of [[Republic of Teresal|Teresal]]): Attained sanity through the ritual tying of knots, poetry and blood-letting. Depicted with her wrist tied in a red string.

- Rosa the 21st: (Named the plate [[Rosalia]]), attained sanity through the ritual of tilling, deciphering and rotting. Depicted with a mummified hand, still attached.

- Sebastian the 76th: attained sanity through archery, lucid dreaming and arsenic. Depicted with a green bow and arrow, and a crown of thorns.

- Garza the 108th: (Patron of [[City-State of Villuvi|Villuvi]]) The most recent sanity, attained through swimming, limbic exploration and exploding. Depicted with a glass bowl atop his head,

## Rituals

The main ritual of Sanatorism comes from that maintaining of the wafer of life, a person can utilize any or most of the methods used by the sanity to achieve Post-life. 

A faithful does not need to do every single ritual, instead the rituals are exclusive to someone, and usually chosen by a priest. Whatever symptom is being felt by the faithful, has a ritual. If a faithful does not have anything in mind, they participate in the daily ritual.

The Daily Ritual is a structured prayer to Dea and the Wafer, first spoken, then followed by the rituals of Peter, employing breath control.

*Graceful Dea, watching distantly,
Wash away the sorrows of my core,
And kill the grief of your departure,
Now and forever, in sanity i remain.*

The self-flagellation is done symbolically with a small harmless feather duster, attached to a rope, called a palid discipline. The historically utilized harmful variation of the whip, known as the crimson discipline, is utilized only in a few sanatorian sects, as the palid is the dominant form of prayer.
