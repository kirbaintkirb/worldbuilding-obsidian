Formatite or simply Form is the only rare earth pseudo-metal, found near the Equatorial Line on the south of [[Chroma]], most commonly in [[Rosalia]], [[Apeter]] and [[Kasha]]. Form is utilized in [[Sprit]] motors and circuits.

Formatite as an element is poorly understood, though there have been empirical observations regarding it's properties, it features an unknown melting point, though it is malleable and ductile, which makes it similar to a metal. 

It's actual atomic components however feature no similarities to any existing elements, it is the zero-th element, featuring no protons, but rather imaginary particles that act as positive charges.

## Reaction 

Form will increase the energy released by an reaction, small energies can become tangible enough to have greater yield. A common application for example is to increase the usable time of flashlights, also used in idyllic engines, which can handle the increase in effect

### Sprit effect

The sprit effectt is the recursive generation of energy utilizing formatite. If two form ingots are contained in any element it and can maintain any charge applied to it. The sprit effect happens due to the imaginary charge, since thermodynamics only affects real values, the imaginary value can accumulate energy potentially forever.

This however is not true, sprit is limited, only plentiful, the origin of the energy is from the background [[Idyllic ]]Plane, by opening a small incision that lets the Form draw in the raw energy, with little physical cost, but with the drawback of imaginary thermodynamics. 

Formatite is extremely toxic to brain tissue, causing Form poisoning, as the kidneys can't remove the metal, it accumulate around the brain, specifically the corpus callossum, which causes it to mineralize.
