Formatite or simply Form is the only rare earth pseudo-metal, found near the Equatorial Line on the south of [[The World]], most commonly in [[Adalaidia]], [[Apetra]] and [[Kasha]]. Form is utilized in [[Sprit]] motors and circuits.

Formatite as an element is poorly understood, though there have been empirical observations regarding it's properties, it features an unknown melting point, though it is malleable and ductile, which makes it similar to a metal. 

It's actual atomic components however feature no similarities to any existing elements, it is the zero-th element, featuring no protons, but rather imaginary particles that act as positive charges.

# Sprit effect

The main effect and application of Form is to exploit the sprit effect, since Form is an imaginary charge you can use it to harness and contain energy from the background [[Idyllic ]] Plane, by opening a small incision that lets the Form draw in the raw energy.

Formatite is extremely toxic to brain tissue, causing Form poisoning, as the kidneys can't remove the metal, it accumulate around the brain, specifically the corpus callossum, which causes it to mineralize.
