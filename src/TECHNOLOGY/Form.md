Formatite or simply Form is the only rare earth pseudo-metal, found near the Equatorial Line on the south of [[Chroma]], most commonly in [[Rosalia]], [[Apeter]] and [[Kasha]]. Form is utilized in [[Sprit]] motors and circuits.

Formatite as an element is poorly understood, though there have been empirical observations regarding it's properties, it features an unknown melting point, though it is malleable and ductile, which makes it similar to a metal. 

It's actual atomic components however feature no similarities to any existing elements, it is the zero-th element, featuring no protons, but rather imaginary particles that act as positive charges.

## Camouflage

Form is a copy material, if enough energy goes through it the form will become a material of the same molecule it is surrounded by maintaining the density, though not the size. The imaginary charge is nullified and culled from the imaginary axis, only leaving a real element. Curiously only elements with an even atomic number can be recreated.

### Sprit effect

The sprit effectt is the recursive generation of energy utilizing formatite. If form is contained in an element with an odd atomic number it will not copy it and can maintain any charge applied to it. The sprit effect happens due to the imaginary charge, since thermodynamics only affects real values, the imaginary value can accumulate energy potentially forever.

This however is not true, sprit is limited, only plentiful, the origin of the energy is from the background [[Idyllic ]]Plane, by opening a small incision that lets the Form draw in the raw energy, with little physical cost, but with the drawback of imaginary thermodynamics. 

Formatite is extremely toxic to brain tissue, causing Form poisoning, as the kidneys can't remove the metal, it accumulate around the brain, specifically the corpus callossum, which causes it to mineralize.
