Interplate Vessels or Long Distance Vessels are a class of ships that can exceed the speed of the gravitational forces that occur in [[Catastrophe Zones#5. Limbo|Limbo]].

The first Long Distance Vessel was the Warbler, a hulking 20.000 tons vessel, shaped not unlike a winged needle. It was created in the year 2499, and launched in [[Limme]] occupied [[Democratic Oumun|Oumun]] at the southern end of the Verland of Dao. It however was not a manned Vessel, only containing radio equipment that might have survived the travel, it did not in fact survive the travel.

The Warbler's wreckage landed in what is now [[Fleuve]] in [[Apetr]], and was able to analyse the plate with some accuracy.

The first manned Interplate Vessel was launched a year later in [[Kingdom of Papoli|Papoli]], the three people involved, Coste Angstrom, Ilio Silva and Darcy Graves were sent on a vessel baptized the Wild Beast, a much smaller vessel and with the ability to make curves much better than the Warbler did. The Wild Beast crossed Limbo on July 16th 2500, and curved above [[Canthara]] to return to [[Ametrie]], landing in the Ametrial Sea with minimal injuries.
