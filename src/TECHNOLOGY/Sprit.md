A Sprit (not to be confused with the term for souls and ghosts, or the term for alcohols), is a type of mechanical device that uses refined [[Form]] to produce enough energy to get energy with a small incision into the [[Idylic]], creating an entrance of raw energy into the world.

Sprits are utilized as a portable partially constant power source, it was first utilized in a rudimentary application for the first [[Long Distance Vessels]], but then were used in modern electro-domestic appliances, computers and automobiles.
