A Sprit (not to be confused with the term for souls and ghosts, or the term for alcohols), is a type of mechanical device that uses refined [[Form]] to essentially make an incision in reality, applying abrasive force to the [[Idyllic|Idyllic Plane]], which causes it to decay into other types of energy.

Metaphorically, sprits essentially extract energy from the Idyllic.

However knowledge of the Idyllic is not commonly known, so most [[City-State of Villuvi|Villuvian]] scientists assume Sprits generate energy seemingly by breaking Thermodynamics.

Sprits are utilized as a portable partially constant power source, it was first utilized in a rudimentary application for the first [[Long Distance Vessels]], but then were used in modern electro-domestic appliances, computers and automobiles.
